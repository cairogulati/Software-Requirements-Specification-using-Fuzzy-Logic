# Software-Requirements-Specification-using-Fuzzy-Logic
The core idea is to be able to efficiently evaluate the various development stages of any particular sector. The objective is to apply Fuzzy Logic on “Teaching-Learning” process.

## Description
### Product Perspective
The project is a new and self-contained product. It uses the application of Fuzzy Logic in
Quantitative Software Engineering. It deals with a dataset, which was collected by the
organization as a feedback from the students, and the concept the of Complex Fuzzy Logic
Reasoning Based Methodologies to categorize the feedbacks in three major segments,
“Expected”, ”Normal” and “Exciting“.

### Product Functions
The idea as mentioned is to accommodate all views and suggestion in a specific sector so to store
and use them to grade the specified attributes later.
• Collection of feedback from students as a dataset
• Use of MATLAB’s toolkit 

### Operating Environment
The software uses MATLAB’s inbuilt toolkit for fuzzy logic and hence can be run on any platform
with MATLAB installed.

### Assumptions and Dependencies
The software for its proper and complete working considers the following assumptions:
1. All key project team members are available and have the necessary skills and knowledge to
work on the project.
2. The feedbacks can only be categorized in three segments.

Dependencies
1. Truth value of data set
2. How effective the toolkit is when applied.
